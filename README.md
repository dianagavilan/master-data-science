Data Science Toolbox
====================

If you're a data scientist, installing all the software you need can be quite involved. The goal of the Data Science Toolbox is to provide a virtual environment that will enable you to start doing data science in a matter of minutes. 

If you're a teacher, author, or company, making sure that your students, readers, or employees have the same software installed (with the correct versions and dependencies) is not straightforward. We envision that this open source project will enable you to easily create a custom virtual environment. 

We're working very hard on the new Data Science Toolbox. In the meantime, you may want to check out the old [repository](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/command-line-tools-for-data-science), which contains a prototype of the Data Science Toolbox.
